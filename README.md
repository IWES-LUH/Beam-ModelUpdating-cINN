# Model updating of a wind turbine blade finite element beam model with invertible neural networks

Scripts to perform finite element beam model updating with Invertible Neural Networks applied to Wind Turbine Blades

Due to space limits the corresponding training and validation data set and trained models for full and reduced parameter space are outsourced to:
